TO USE THIS TEST:
enter command (from the mt_db directory)
'./server_[coarse|rw|fine] < tests/listTree/listTree_server'

create_listTree.py: This is a Python script which writes the delete files and listTree file.
delete1 - delete8: These are a series of database commands which delete nodes from the database starting at the bottom of the tree and working up.
listTree: The list of database commands to create all the initial nodes for the tree. The nodes are added in sequential order, so the tree should essentially be a linked list of nodes.
listTree_server: The server commands to be piped in to the program.
